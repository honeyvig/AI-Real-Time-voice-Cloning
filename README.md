# AI-Real-Time-voice-Cloning
Creating a voice cloning technology using AI, especially for music and performance purposes, is a highly advanced task that involves several components. You will need to use a combination of deep learning models and techniques for voice synthesis, like WaveNet, Tacotron 2, or FastSpeech, and potentially some additional tools like Real-Time Voice Cloning to clone voices. This type of technology allows you to generate voice audio from text input that closely mimics the sound and style of a specific person.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how you can achieve this using Python and several deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and pre-trained models for voice cloning. The ultimate goal is to create AI-generated performances that can be used for an EP (Extended Play).
Step 1: Set up a Voice Cloning Environment

Before jumping into the code, ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

pip install tensorflow torch librosa numpy scipy soundfile matplotlib

Additionally, for cloning voices specifically, Real-Time Voice Cloning (https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning) is one of the most famous repositories for cloning voices.

You can clone a specific person's voice using a pre-trained model and generate high-quality audio outputs.
Step 2: Clone a Voice using Real-Time Voice Cloning

One popular method of voice cloning is using the Real-Time Voice Cloning model, which is based on a combination of:

    Speaker Encoder (for extracting speaker embeddings),
    Synthesizer (for text-to-speech synthesis),
    Vocoder (for waveform generation).

The official Real-Time Voice Cloning repository (from CorentinJ) already has a pretrained model, so you can focus on setting up the environment and generating voices with it.

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning.git
cd Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Generate Synthetic Voice for Music Performance

Here’s how you can use the voice cloning model to synthesize speech or singing in your desired artist's voice. This is an example of using a pre-trained model to generate a performance based on a given text (lyrics of a song, for example):

import torch
from pathlib import Path
import librosa
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf
import sys
import os
from synthesizer import Synthesizer
from encoder import inference as encoder
from vocoder import inference as vocoder
from synthesizer import inference as synthesizer

# Function to load pre-trained models
def load_models():
    print("Loading models...")
    encoder.load_model(Path("pretrained_models/encoder"))
    synthesizer.load_model(Path("pretrained_models/synthesizer"))
    vocoder.load_model(Path("pretrained_models/vocoder"))
    print("Models loaded successfully!")

# Function to synthesize voice from text
def synthesize_voice(text, output_file="output.wav"):
    print("Synthesizing voice...")

    # Preprocess text into phonemes
    texts = [text]
    # Convert text into mel spectrogram using synthesizer
    specs = synthesizer.synthesize_spectrograms(texts)
    
    # Generate waveform from mel spectrogram using vocoder
    waveform = vocoder.infer_waveform(specs[0])

    # Save the output to a WAV file
    sf.write(output_file, waveform, synthesizer.sample_rate)
    print(f"Voice synthesized and saved to {output_file}")

# Function to clone the voice from a reference speaker
def clone_voice(reference_audio, text_to_speak, output_file="cloned_output.wav"):
    # Extract speaker embedding from the reference audio
    print(f"Extracting speaker embedding from {reference_audio}...")
    embed = encoder.embed_utterance(reference_audio)
    
    # Synthesize voice from the embedding
    print(f"Synthesizing voice for: {text_to_speak}...")
    synthesizer.synthesize_spectrograms([text_to_speak], embed)
    
    # Create the waveform using vocoder
    specs = synthesizer.synthesize_spectrograms([text_to_speak])
    waveform = vocoder.infer_waveform(specs[0])
    
    # Save the result to output file
    sf.write(output_file, waveform, synthesizer.sample_rate)
    print(f"Cloned voice saved to {output_file}")

# Main function to run the performance creation
def create_performance(lyrics_text, reference_audio, output_filename="performance_output.wav"):
    load_models()  # Load models

    # Generate the performance by cloning the voice and singing the lyrics
    clone_voice(reference_audio, lyrics_text, output_filename)
    print(f"Performance generated and saved as {output_filename}")

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Path to the reference audio of the voice you'd like to clone (e.g., an artist's recording)
    reference_audio = "path_to_reference_audio.wav"
    
    # Lyrics/text for the song or performance
    lyrics = """
    We are going to perform with AI voice
    Our music is made of light and sound
    Listen to the rhythm, feel the flow
    AI is here to help us grow
    """
    
    # Output filename
    output_filename = "ai_performance.wav"

    # Create AI-generated performance
    create_performance(lyrics, reference_audio, output_filename)

Step 4: Detailed Breakdown of the Code

    Model Loading: The load_models() function loads the pretrained models for the encoder, synthesizer, and vocoder.
        Encoder: This component extracts speaker embeddings from reference audio.
        Synthesizer: This converts input text (lyrics) into a spectrogram (the visual representation of sound).
        Vocoder: Converts the spectrogram into an actual waveform (audio).

    Voice Cloning: The clone_voice() function takes a reference audio file (e.g., a recording from the target artist) and extracts the speaker's voice characteristics (embedding). Then, it synthesizes the desired text into the cloned voice.

    Synthesize Performance: The create_performance() function combines all steps to synthesize the performance. It first loads the models, then synthesizes the lyrics using the cloned voice and outputs the final result as an audio file.

Step 5: Customize for EP Creation

    To create an EP (Extended Play), you can modify the lyrics_text with different song lyrics and repeat the create_performance() function to generate multiple songs.
    Additionally, you can manipulate parameters such as pitch, tone, and tempo to match the style of the artist you’re cloning.

Step 6: Audio Enhancements (Optional)

To further enhance the quality of the AI-generated voice for musical purposes, you might want to:

    Use audio effects like reverb, delay, or EQ to make the generated voice sound more natural.
    Integrate music composition tools (e.g., Magenta, MuseNet) to create instrumental backgrounds that match the AI-generated vocals.

Step 7: Deployment for Live Use

To deploy this for a live performance or real-time application, you can integrate this AI into a real-time audio processing pipeline using frameworks like:

    PyAudio for capturing and generating audio streams.
    Flask or FastAPI to expose voice synthesis as a REST API for web-based interaction.

Conclusion

The Python code provided is a basic outline for creating a voice cloning system using pre-trained models like Real-Time Voice Cloning. By leveraging AI and machine learning models such as Tacotron 2, WaveNet, or FastSpeech, you can generate high-quality, AI-powered performances for an upcoming EP. You can tweak this approach to include multiple songs, enhance audio with music production tools, and create a seamless AI-powered music experience.
